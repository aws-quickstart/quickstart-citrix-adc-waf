// We need to work around Step numbers here if we are going to potentially exclude the AMI subscription
=== Confirm your AWS account configuration

. Sign in to your AWS account at https://aws.amazon.com with an IAM user role that has the necessary permissions. For details, see link:#_planning_the_deployment[Planning the deployment] earlier in this guide.
. Use the Region selector in the navigation bar to choose the AWS Region where you want to deploy high availability across AWS Availability Zones.
. Make sure that your AWS account is configured correctly, as discussed in the link:#_technical_requirements[Technical requirements] section.

=== Subscribe to the {partner-product-short-name} AMI

This Quick Start requires a subscription to the AMI for {partner-product-short-name} in AWS Marketplace.

. Sign in to your AWS account.
. For the PAYG model, you can choose one of the following AWS Marketplace AMIs: https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B08286P96W?qid=1580407778935&sr=0-9&ref_=srh_res_product_title[Citrix WAF 200 Mbps] or https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B08284R8P6?qid=1580407778935&sr=0-10&ref_=srh_res_product_title[Citrix WAF 1000 Mbps]. For the BYOL model, refer to the link:#_software_licenses[Software licenses] section to see the available options. To retrieve the AMI ID, see https://github.com/citrix/citrix-adc-aws-cloudformation/blob/master/templates/README.md[Citrix Products on AWS Marketplace] on GitHub.
. On the desired AWS Marketplace page, choose *Continue to Subscribe.*
. Review the terms and conditions for software usage, and then choose *Accept Terms*. A confirmation page loads, and an email confirmation is sent to the account owner. For detailed subscription instructions, see the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/help/200799470[AWS Marketplace documentation].
. When the subscription process is complete, exit out of AWS Marketplace without further action. *Do not* provision the software from AWS Marketplace—the Quick Start deploys the AMI for you.

=== Launch the Quick Start

WARNING: If you’re deploying {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC, make sure that your VPC has two private subnets in different Availability Zones for the workload instances, and that the subnets aren’t shared. This Quick Start doesn’t support https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html[shared subnets^]. These subnets require https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html[NAT gateways^] in their route tables, to allow the instances to download packages and software without exposing them to the internet.
Also, make sure that the domain name option in the DHCP options is configured as explained in the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html[Amazon VPC documentation^]. You provide your VPC settings when you launch the Quick Start.

Each deployment takes about {deployment_time} to complete.

. Sign in to your AWS account, and choose one of the following options to launch the AWS CloudFormation template. For help with choosing an option, see link:#_deployment_options[deployment options] earlier in this guide.

. Check the AWS Region that's displayed in the upper-right corner of the navigation bar, and change it if necessary. This Region is where you build the infrastructure. The template is launched in the {default_deployment_region} Region by default. For a current list of supported Regions, see the https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-adc/13/deploying-vpx/deploy-aws/vpx-aws-support-matrix.html[VPX-AWS support matrix^] in the Citrix documentation. For more information, see link:#_supported_aws_regions[Supported AWS Regions] earlier in this guide.
. On the *Create stack* page, keep the default setting for the template URL, and then choose *Next*.
. On the *Specify stack details* page, change the stack name if needed. Review the parameters for the template. Provide values for the parameters that require input. For all other parameters, review the default settings and customize them as necessary. For details on each parameter, see the link:#_parameter_reference[Parameter reference] section of this guide. When you finish reviewing and customizing the parameters, choose *Next*.
