=== Subscribe to the {partner-product-short-name} AMI

This Partner Solution requires a subscription to the AMI for {partner-product-short-name} in AWS Marketplace.

. Sign in to your AWS account.
. For the PAYG model, you can choose one of the following AWS Marketplace AMIs: https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B08286P96W?qid=1580407778935&sr=0-9&ref_=srh_res_product_title[Citrix WAF 200 Mbps] or https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B08284R8P6?qid=1580407778935&sr=0-10&ref_=srh_res_product_title[Citrix WAF 1000 Mbps]. For the BYOL model, refer to the link:#_software_licenses[Software licenses] section to see the available options. To retrieve the AMI ID, see https://github.com/citrix/citrix-adc-aws-cloudformation/blob/master/templates/README.md[Citrix Products on AWS Marketplace] on GitHub.
. On the desired AWS Marketplace page, choose *Continue to Subscribe.*
. Review the terms and conditions for software usage, and then choose *Accept Terms*. A confirmation page loads, and an email confirmation is sent to the account owner. For detailed subscription instructions, see the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/help/200799470[AWS Marketplace documentation].
. When the subscription process is complete, exit out of AWS Marketplace without further action. *Do not* provision the software from AWS Marketplaceâ€”the Partner Solution deploys the AMI for you.
