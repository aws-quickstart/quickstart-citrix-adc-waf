'''
*Q.* The vserver (`sample_lb_vserver`) is showing as *down*.

*A.* This might be because no backend servers have been deployed. We recommend configuring service and service groups and binding them with the load-balancing virtual servers (LB vservers). For more information, see https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/netscaler/12/load-balancing/load-balancing-manage-large-scale-deployment/configure-service-groups.html[Configure service groups].

'''
*Q.* While testing in my environment, the backend servers in the remote Availability Zone show as *down*.

*A.* Try one of the following options:

* Add a static route to the remote Availability Zone server subnet by specifying the subnet IP address (SNIP) as the next hop. For more information, see https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/netscaler/12/networking/ip-routing/configuring-static-routes.html[Configuring static routes].
* Change the subnet mask so that subnets in both Availability Zones are accommodated.

'''
*Q.* I get the error “FAIL: Could not add licenseserver.”

*A.* You probably selected *Yes* when prompted, “Do you want to allocate license from ADM?” and then provided incorrect ADM/Agent IP, which is not reachable. To solve the issue, configure your management interface in such a way that you get access to the endpoints via NAT gateway and associate this NAT gateway with the management subnet (if not already done) in both the Availability Zones, or separate VPC endpoints for S3 and EC2 need to be configured.

'''
*Q.* I get this error: Failed to create resource. See the details in CloudWatch Log Stream: HTTPSConnectionPool(host=’’, port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /nitro/v1/config/route (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at ‘’>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 110] Connection timed out',))`

*A.* This could be due to an existing VPC deployment when amazonaws endpoints (http://ec2.amazonaws.com/[ec2.amazonaws.com] and http://s3.amazonaws.com/[s3.amazonaws.com]) are not reachable. As a resolution, create a NAT gateway in the public subnet and thereby associate this NAT gateway with the management subnet (if not already done) in both the Availability Zones.
