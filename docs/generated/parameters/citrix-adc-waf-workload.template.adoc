|Parameter label (name) |Default value|Description|VPC ID

(`BastionSecurityGroupID`)|`**__Requires input__**`|(Optional) The security group ID associated with the bastion host, if present. This will be used to allow access from the bastion hosts to the interfaces belonging to the security groups that will be created for the Citrix WAF HA pair. Effectively the bastion hosts will be able to open connections to all WAF interfaces (management, client and server).|Restricted SSH CIDR
(`RestrictedSSHCIDR`)|`**__Requires input__**`|A CIDR block that is allowed to access the bastion host(if present) or WAF management interface on port 22. We recommend that you use a constrained CIDR range to reduce the potential of inbound attacks from unknown IP addresses. Note:  Since the WAF management interface is deployed in a private subnet, you will need to initiate the SSH connection from a host with network connectivity to this private subnet, like bastion host or on-prem host with Direct Connect.|Restricted Web App CIDR
(`RestrictedWebAppCIDR`)|`**__Requires input__**`|A CIDR block that is allowed to access the web apps behind WAF on TCP ports 80, 443. We recommend that you use a constrained CIDR range to reduce the potential of inbound attacks from unknown IP addresses. Using 0.0.0.0/0, will enable all IP addresses to access your instance using SSH.|Primary management private subnet ID

(`PrimaryServerPrivateIP`)|`**__Requires input__**`|(Optional) This is the server private IP address of the primary Citrix WAF instance (last octet must be between 5 and 254). It is automatically assigned from the primary server subnet CIDR.|Secondary management private IP (NSIP)
(`SecondaryManagementPrivateIP`)|`**__Requires input__**`|(Optional) This is the management private IP address of the secondary Citrix WAF instance (last octet must be between 5 and 254). It is automatically assigned from the secondary management subnet CIDR.|Secondary client private IP (VIP)
(`SecondaryClientPrivateIP`)|`**__Requires input__**`|(Optional) This is the client private IP address of the secondary Citrix WAF instance (last octet must be between 5 and 254). It is automatically assigned from the secondary client subnet CIDR.|Secondary server private IP (SNIP)
